👋 Hi, I'm Mark Magdy
🎯 Aspiring Backend Developer | 💻 Curious Problem Solver | 🛠️ Always Learning

🚀 About Me
I'm currently a third-year computer science student with a growing interest in backend development and system-level programming. I’ve been learning the fundamentals of computer science — including data structures, algorithms, operating systems, networks, and database systems — and trying to apply them through small projects, learning exercises, and problem solving.

I enjoy understanding how things work beneath the surface. I'm still early in my journey, but I’m always looking for opportunities to learn more, build better, and grow as a developer.
